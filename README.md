Little Light is a Destiny 2 discord bot and personal assistant. This project is built in python and uses the [Bungie Destiny 2 API](https://bungie-net.github.io) to provide players with information from the game in real-time.

For now Little Light has a few features that need to be generalized to work on any server. So please feel free to join Wackson's Sherpa Shack to see the bot in action or play Destiny 2 with us!
